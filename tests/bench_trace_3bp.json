The crowd roars as you step into the sandy pit, *Dawncleaver* catching the light.\n\nFrom the stands, Lyra watches with her typical stillness, eyes tracking every movement. Maren leans forward, her expression a mix of concern and grim anticipation. \"Don't get cocky,\" she'd warned before you entered.\n\nKrag circles you, his massive axe held with casual confidence. The crowd's noise fades to a distant hum. Your scar throbs slightly—an old instinct warning you of danger.\n\n\"First blood or yield,\" the arena master announces.\n\nKrag grins, revealing tusks. \"Let's see if you're as good as the rumors say, swordsman.\"\n\nHe charges with surprising speed for his size, axe raised high.\n\nWhat",

Your party is genuinely exhausted now. Supplies are critically low—you're down to three days of rations, and Maren's medicinal herbs are nearly depleted. The amulet you recovered remains secured in your pack, its faint blue glow occasionally visible. Whatever power it holds, it's remained dormant since that initial overwhelming surge.\n\nVillagers nod as you pass the outer buildings. Children pause their games to watch Zephyr circle overhead. The Rusty Tankard's sign creaks invitingly in the wind—warm light spills from its windows.\n\nElder Bram stands near the Earth Titan shrine in the village square, as if he'd been waiting for you. The retired adventurer's weathered face breaks into a knowing smile. His one good eye—the other clouded from an old scar—assesses your condition with practiced precision.\n\n\"You've the look of those who've found trouble *and* survived it,\" he says",

Spectators fill the stands—merchants, sailors, mercenaries, and curious onlookers. The crowd roars as you step into the sandy pit, *Dawncleaver* catching the afternoon sunlight. Your armor has been cleaned and repaired; you look every bit the seasoned warrior.\n\nFrom the stands, Lyra watches with her typical stillness, her pale eyes tracking every nuance of movement. Maren leans forward, her expression a mix of concern and grim anticipation. \"Don't get cocky,\" she'd warned before you entered the arena proper.\n\nKrag circles you, his massive axe held with casual confidence born from countless victories. The crowd's noise fades to a distant roar. Your scar throbs slightly—an old instinct warning of genuine danger.\n\n\"First blood or yield,\" the arena master announces.\n\nK",

The smell hits you first: spiced meat, leather, exotic incense, and the earthy musk of packed earth and animals. Colorful awnings snap in the wind. You can hear a dozen languages being haggled in simultaneously.\n\nYour wolf pelts have aged well during travel—still supple, still valuable. You make your way toward Corvin's hide stall, the grizzled merchant with the wolf-fur cloak you've dealt with before.\n\n\"Back again,\" Corvin says, recognizing you immediately. He examines your pelts with practiced efficiency, running weathered fingers across the fur. \"Quality work. Dire wolf, these are. I'll give you 55 gold for the lot. Fair price.\"\n\nYou negotiate briefly—his final offer is 62 gold, which you accept. The coin feels substantial in your purse.\n\n\"The Sunken Temple",

Your vision explodes into a thousand overlapping moments: robed figures in pre-Sundering garb chanting in Old Imperial, the amulet being forged in flames that burn with water-element magic, ancient ceremonies performed in this very chamber centuries ago.\n\nThen—a warning. A voice that isn't quite a voice, more like pressure against your mind: *\"The fragments awaken. The Veil watches. Time grows short.\"*\n\n\"Kael!\" Maren shouts, reaching for you, but her hand passes through a shimmering barrier of water-aspected energy that erupts from the amulet.\n\nYou're suspended between moments, caught in the amulet's memory. The cavern walls begin to *resonate*, humming at a frequency that vibrates through your bones. Water droplets from the ceiling quiver and fall like rain. The carved runes along the passage walls flare with faint blue luminescence, responding to the amulet's awakening—and broadcasting that awakening outward like a beacon across the forest.\n\n\"",

Spectators fill the stands—merchants, sailors, mercenaries, and curious onlookers. The crowd roars as you step into the sandy pit, *Dawncleaver* catching the afternoon sunlight. Your armor has been cleaned and repaired; you look every bit the seasoned warrior.\n\nFrom the stands, Lyra watches with her typical stillness, her pale eyes tracking every nuance of movement. Maren leans forward, her expression a mix of concern and grim anticipation. \"Don't get cocky,\" she'd warned before you entered.\n\nKrag circles you, his massive axe held with casual confidence born from countless victories. The crowd's noise fades to a distant roar. Your scar throbs slightly—an old instinct warning of genuine danger.\n\n\"First blood or yield,\" the arena master announces.\n\nKrag grins",

The decision to return to the Crossroads Market was practical: sell the wolf pelts you've been carrying, gather fresh intelligence, and resupply before attempting the temple's interior.\n\nThe market sprawls before you in its familiar chaotic glory—a nexus of commerce where traders from across Eldoria converge. The smell hits you first: spiced meat, leather, exotic incense, and the earthy musk of packed earth and animals. Colorful awnings snap in the wind. You can hear a dozen languages being haggled in simultaneously.\n\nYour wolf pelts have aged well during travel—still supple, still valuable. You make your way toward Corvin's hide stall, the grizzled merchant with the wolf-fur cloak you've dealt with before. He's examining some fresh bear hides when you approach.\n\n\"Back again,\" Corvin says, recognizing you immediately. He examines your pelts with practiced efficiency. \"Quality work. Dire wolf, these are. I'll give you 60 gold for the lot. Fair price for the market.\"\n\nYou negotiate briefly—his final offer is 68 gold, which you accept. The coins feel substantial in your purse",

The amulet in your pack pulses faintly in response, as if recognizing kinship with this old magic.\n\nYou call Maren over. The dwarf woman's expression shifts immediately from casual watchfulness to intense focus. She sets down *Boneset* and approaches reverently, running her calloused fingers across the inscriptions. Her lips move silently as she reads, her eyes—sharp despite the firelight—scan methodically from top to bottom.\n\n\"Aye, I can read it,\" she says finally, her voice carrying unexpected gravity. \"Old Deephold dialect. Pre-Sundering work, definitely. Maybe older still.\" She traces a particular sequence with her weathered finger. \"This here says 'Vault of the Stone Keepers.' And this seal—\" she points to an elaborate symbol beneath the text, \"—that's the mark of the Iron Covenant. High security. Protection wards, probably. Nasty ones.\"\n\nLyra steps beside you, her hand resting on her bow.",

Your vision explodes into a thousand overlapping moments: robed figures in pre-Sundering garb chanting in Old Imperial, the amulet being forged in flames that burn with water-element magic, ancient ceremonies performed in this very chamber centuries ago.\n\nThen—a warning. A voice that isn't quite a voice, more like pressure against your mind: *\"The fragments awaken. The Veil watches. Time grows short.\"*\n\n\"Kael!\" Maren shouts, reaching for you, but her hand passes through a shimmering barrier of water-aspected energy that erupts from the amulet.\n\nYou're suspended between moments, caught in the amulet's memory. The cavern walls begin to *resonate*, humming at a frequency that vibrates through your bones. Water droplets from the ceiling quiver and fall like rain. The carved runes along the passage walls flare with faint blue luminescence, responding to the amulet's awakening—and broadcasting that awakening outward like a beacon across the forest.",

Spectators fill the stands—merchants, sailors, mercenaries, and curious onlookers. The crowd roars as you step into the sandy pit, *Dawncleaver* catching the afternoon sunlight. Your armor has been cleaned and repaired; you look every bit the seasoned warrior.\n\nFrom the stands, Lyra watches with her typical stillness, her pale eyes tracking every nuance of movement. Maren leans forward, her expression a mix of concern and grim anticipation. \"Don't get cocky,\" she'd warned before you entered.\n\nKrag circles you, his massive axe held with casual confidence born from countless victories. The crowd's noise fades to a distant roar. Your scar throbs slightly—an old instinct warning of genuine danger.\n\n\"First blood or yield,\" the arena master announces.\n\nKrag grins",
