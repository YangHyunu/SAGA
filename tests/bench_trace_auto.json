She leans Boneset against her shoulder, studying the ruins with a healer's eye for danger. \"Aye, this reeks of old magic, Kael. See how the moss grows in spirals? That's no natural pattern. Something's been *feeding* on the life here.\" She taps a chunk of stone at your feet—it crumbles to dust. \"Void corruption, I'd wager. Not fresh, but... persistent.\"\n\nThe air tastes metallic.

You need to tell me when you're hurt, aye?\"\n\n\"It was manageable,\" Lyra replies quietly, testing her shoulder's movement. Already the swelling has reduced.\n\nThe forest around you rustles—just wind through leaves, but your hand instinctively moves to Dawncleaver's hilt.

The void-amulet's presence makes discretion wise.\n\nThe evening is cool, carrying that peculiar salt-and-earth smell of places where river meets ocean. You settle onto a log facing the darkness, Dawncleaver across your lap, while behind you Maren works on Lyra's shoulder wound.\n\n\"This is older than I thought,\" Maren says, her tone shifting from jovial to clinical. She carefully unwraps the bandage from the dire wolf injury sustained days ago. The flesh beneath is healing well—her earth magic has done its work—but thin purple streaks now web outward from the wound's edges. \"Void corruption. The amulet's proximity is affecting you both.\"\n\nLyra sits motionless, her elven composure unshaken despite the pain. \"How long before it spreads?\"\n\n\"Days, maybe a week if we're lucky.\" Maren applies fresh poultice, her hands glowing soft green. \"We need Port Serenade's mages, Kael. Not just for you—for her too.\"",

Stars emerge overhead, piercing the darkening sky.\n\nMaren works methodically on Lyra's shoulder wound—the one from the dire wolf pack three days ago. She's unwrapped the bandage, revealing flesh that should be healing cleanly. Instead, thin purple streaks web outward from the puncture marks, creeping slowly up toward the elf's neck.\n\n\"This is worse than before,\" Maren says, her jovial tone replaced with clinical concern. She applies fresh poultice, her hands glowing soft green with earth magic. \"The void corruption from that amulet you touched—it's spreading through the camp, affecting all of us. Your wrist, her wound... it's all connected.\"\n\nLyra sits motionless, her elven composure unshaken. \"How long?\"\n\n\"Days, maybe a week if we're fortunate.\" Maren wraps clean linen around the shoulder. \"We need Port Serenade's Arcane Conclave. They have mages trained in void cleansing.\"",

The symbol marking the Sunken Temple entrance grows clearer in your mind, almost as if the ancient parchment is guiding you directly.\n\nAfter two days of hard travel, the landscape shifts dramatically. The river widens into a vast, still lake. And there—rising from mist-shrouded waters like a drowned god's monument—stands the Sunken Temple.\n\nYour breath catches. Once-grand columns pierce the water's surface, their carved stones slick with algae and age. The main edifice sinks beneath the dark mirror, its upper levels barely visible through the murk. Pre-Sundering murals depict robed figures making offerings to a figure wreathed in water and light: the Water Titan.\n\nBut something is *wrong*.\n\nThe water surrounding the temple roils with unnatural purple luminescence—void corruption, spreading like poison.

Healing herbs, fresh rations, anything you can spare.

The air grows cooler, carrying the salt-tang of distant ocean mixed with something else: stagnant water and decay.\n\nYour map fragment pulses faintly in your pack—responding to proximity. The symbol marking the Sunken Temple entrance grows clearer in your mind, almost as if the ancient parchment is guiding you directly toward your destination.\n\nAfter three days of hard travel, the landscape shifts dramatically. The river widens into a vast, still lake. And there—rising from mist-shrouded waters like a drowned god's monument—stands the Sunken Temple.\n\nYour breath catches. Once-grand columns pierce the water's surface, their carved stones slick with algae and age. The main edifice sinks beneath the dark mirror, its upper levels barely visible through the murk. Pre-Sundering murals depict robed figures making offerings to a figure wreathed in water and light: the Water Titan himself.\n\nBut something is *wrong*.\n\nThe water surrounding the temple roils with unnatural purple luminescence—void corruption, spreading like poison through the sacred waters.
